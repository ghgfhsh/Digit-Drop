# Digit-Drop

Digit Drop is a game I made for my wife as an alternative to similar style games that are littered with ads. The app should be compatible for all platforms unity supports.
It's only been tested on android and windows, so if you want an alternative platform build you can download this project and build it yourself within unity. 

# Rules and Controls
A digit will spawn with a random number based on the current difficulty level and it will start falling. Touch any row to switch rows, and hold to double it's speed. 
If it drops on digits match it will double the digit for the amount of digits matched. The difficulty level will increase based on certain numbers being reached. Enjoy!
